# Sonar Message Translator

This Lambda is triggered by **SQS**. It:

1. Extracts text from the message body,
2. Detect the language with **Amazon Comprehend**,
3. Translates non-English text to English using **Amazon Translate**,
4. Posts a compact result JSON to a **webhook** (HTTP POST).

SQS may send multiple records within the `event`.  
So make sure you can don't lose any!

## Flow

**SQS queue → Lambda (this function) → Comprehend → Translate → Webhook (HTTP POST)**

## Webhook
Many modern applications support webhooks in one way or another. You could use Teams, Discord or Slack.

In our experience Discord is probably the easiest, part of server integrations:
